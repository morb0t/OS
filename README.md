# Development of an Operating System on NXP LPC5569  

I led the development of an **embedded operating system** on the **NXP LPC5569** board, designed for task management and peripheral control.  

## Main Features  
- **Task Management**: Implementation of a scheduler enabling multitasking execution.  
- **Peripheral Control**: Management and control of components such as **LEDs**.  
- **UART Communication**: Establishment of a serial communication interface for data exchange.  

This system optimizes hardware resource utilization and facilitates the development of embedded applications on the **LPC5569** platform.
